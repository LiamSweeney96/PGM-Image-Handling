For this assignment I will be implementing Unit Testing, 
Integration Testing, and Functional Testing. The purpose
of these tests are to ensure the code is robust and works
as intended. The unit testing will enable isolation of different 
areas of the program to ensure they are correct through its 
strict nature. If the code doesn't satisfy these tests,
it will fail.

Integration testing allows for testing modules as a 
combined group which will show if there are any bugs 
with the programme when attempting to run it as one. 
This stage will occur after the unit tests have all been 
passed. Finally, functional tests will be undertaken. 
This is to ensure the output that is given from the 
programme is always correct, and that there are no 
specific inputs that, when entered, break the programme.
